# JAVA_Assignments


Hello everyone,  
In this repository, I uploaded all of my assignments I've done in my Introduction to Computer Science course.   
These assignments cover all the foundamental knowledge in JAVA including recursion, OOP, Array etc....  
In the next Semester, I'm going to delve deeper in the algorithm world to stremeline my code efficiency better.   
Hope you enjoy the works I done so far.
